Hi there! Thanks for purchasing the asset, I really hope you enjoy it and that it helps you take your projects to the next level :D

If this is your first time using the asset reading the First Steps section of the Documentation PDF or watching this quick overview video is the best place to start:

You will learn the basic workflow in a matter of minutes. And then, to learn all the asset can do you can proceed to read the rest of the Documentation or to watch all the other video tutorials.

The asset is mainly targeted to be used in sprites and UI. But it can be used anywhere. Many creative users also use the asset in Meshes and VFX materials.
That being said I just made a new specialized asset for VFX. It's a spiritual successor to this asset but made with VFX creation in mind.
It has an awesome shader, more than 50 ready to use example prefabs, a huge asset library, editor tools and more.
